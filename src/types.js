/**
 * A brief overview of the different code formatting providers:
 *
 * == Range formatters ==
 * These accept a range to format and return a list of edits to apply.
 * These will always be preferred over file formatters when a range is selected.
 *
 * == File formatters ==
 * These always return the result of formatting the entire file.
 * To compensate, they can return a custom cursor position to avoid disruption.
 * These will be preferred over range formatters for whole-file formatting.
 *
 * == onType formatters ==
 * These are run after every typing event in a selected editor.
 *
 * == onSave formatters ==
 * These are run whenever a selected editor is saved.
 * If the global format-on-save option is enabled, then file/range formatters
 * will be triggered on save (even if no save formatters are provided).
 * Obviously, save formatters are preferred in this case.
